# Emacs

My Emacs configuration. Not much, but it is honest work :)

Put init.el and emacs-custom.el in ~/.emacs.d directory.

Put .bashrc in ~/.bashrc . In that file there is line 
`
alias emacs='/usr/local/bin/emacsclient_script.sh'
`

which make emacs work as a client. Put emacsclient_script.sh in that path.
In process of development...
