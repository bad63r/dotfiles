# My config for urxvt
Simple but it's all I need.

All configurations are done in `~/.Xresources`. For full functionality of the configs you need to copy some perl scripts to
```/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/urxvt/perl/ ```
1)keyboard-select 
2)url-select
3)clipboard (```sudo apt install xclip```)

You need to install Hack fonts with: `sudo apt-get install fonts-hack-ttf` for better looking urxvt.
