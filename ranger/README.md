# Ranger config files
Afer installing ranger(file manager) you should do 
`ranger --copy-config=all` 
That will copy default config files into your ``` ~/.config/```. Editing those files will overwrite default ones. 
You need to configure only two of those files: *rc.conf* and *rifle.conf*.
Place those two files into ```~/.config/ranger```
