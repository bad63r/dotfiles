# Rofi - A window switcher, Application launcher and dmenu replacement

This is my config for rofi.

Put _config, nord.rasi_ files in `~/.config/rofi/`. 

Then afer that you can simply run program with:
`bindsym $mod+d exec "rofi -show drun -terminal urxvt"
` or bind it to desired shortcut in i3wm and run it as that :)
For shortcuts look into config file.
